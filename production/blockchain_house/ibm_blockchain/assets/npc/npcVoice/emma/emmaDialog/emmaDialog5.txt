Do you wanna go trying our initial model IBM BlockChain Minigame? This reflects my research interests centred around agent-based systems, particularly agent-based modelling of human behaviour, from cognitive modelling to social simulation! Oh!, it might be incorporated into computational models, both in the context of improving models of human behaviour, and also in designing better computational and robotic interfaces. (Automatically send you to IBM BlockChain Arcade Zone!)
