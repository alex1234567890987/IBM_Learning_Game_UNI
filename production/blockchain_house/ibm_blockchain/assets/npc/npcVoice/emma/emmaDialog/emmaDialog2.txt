Again, I'm Dr. Emma Norling, Senior University teacher. I obtained BEng (Hons) from the University of Melbourne, worked as a tutor and lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at this institution, moving on to complete my PhD in Computer Science here. I undertook postdoctoral studies in the Centre for Policy Modelling (Manchester Metropolitan University), before moving into a lecturing position in the School of Mathematics, Computing and Digital Technology there.
