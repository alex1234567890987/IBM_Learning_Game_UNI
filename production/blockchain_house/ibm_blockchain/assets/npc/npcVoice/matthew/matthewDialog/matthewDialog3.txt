After completing my PhD in 2015, I joined the group of Prof. Stefano Sanvito at Trinity College Dublin as a post-doctoral research fellow. In 2019, I joined the University of Sheffield as a post-doctoral research associate in the Bio-Inpsired Machine Learning group under Prof. Eleni Vasilaki developing machine learning models for neuromorphic computing in collaboration with the Department of Materials Science.
