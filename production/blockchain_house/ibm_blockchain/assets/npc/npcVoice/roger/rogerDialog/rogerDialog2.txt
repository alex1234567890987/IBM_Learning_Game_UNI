I'm Roger Moore, the Professor of Spoken Language Processing and Member of the Speech and Hearing (SpandH) research group at the Department of Computer Science. I have gained over 40 yearsâ€™ experience in Speech Technology R&D and, although an engineer by training, much of my research has been based on insights from human speech perception and production.
